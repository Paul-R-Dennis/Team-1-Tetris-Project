            <h1>Rules</h1>
            <p>The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by clearing lines of blocks before they
                reach the top of the screen.</p>
            <p>The game consists of seven different shapes known as Tetrominoes that are made up of four squares each.
                These shapes are the I, J, L, O, S, T, and Z Tetrominoes.</p>
            <p>The game begins with a single Tetromino falling from the top of the screen.</p>
            <p>As the Tetromino falls, the player can also speed up its descent by pressing the down arrow key. Once the
                Tetromino reaches the bottom of the screen, it locks into place, and a new Tetromino falls from the top.
            </p>
            <p>The player can clear lines by filling every square in a row with blocks. When a line is cleared, any
                blocks above it will fall to fill the gap, and the player scores points.</p>
            <p>The game ends when the blocks stack up to the top of the screen, and the player can no longer move or
                rotate them.</p>
